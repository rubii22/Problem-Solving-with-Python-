# Problem Statement

# Write a program that asks a user to enter a number. Your program will then double that number and print out the result. It will repeat that process until the value is 100 or greater.

# Solution
def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))      
    while num < 100:  
        num *= 2  
        print("Doubled value:", num)
    
    print("ðŸš€ Final value reached:", num)  

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
